          <p>Hello! Iâ€™m a student Graphic Designer based in Ottawa, Ontario. I am constantly being inspired by the beauty around me and the creativity that comes with the inspiration. My interests include hiking, skiing, drawing, and travelling. My family and friends are incredibly important to me and have helped me along this journey of becoming a designer.</p>

              <p>The main goal of this piece was to re design an existing movie poster and give it my own twist. It had to display enough differences from the original poster, however, keep with the personality of the movie.</p>
